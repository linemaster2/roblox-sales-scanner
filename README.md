# Roblox Sales Scanner

What does this do? this will loop through all the sales of goods, and check for valid purchases by using the sale idHash, if the purchase was valid by the right person (user id) it will return True if not then False. this is the same method we use for [sql services](https://discord.gg/yuth). (no we don't save all the hashes in a json file lol i simply rushed this open source project)
please note that this is REALLY simple, should be only used for learning purposes.

This doesn't include the discord bot for the invoices and stuff. this only includes the MAIN functions, you ARE allowed to use this in your project.

Also make sure you change the configuration file (.env) before yapping about it not working
